ElectricBee's Aerials was created with love and passion, as a response to Iron Bob's Aerials being all messed up. There were several problems I had discovered in the creation of this kit;

* His aerials were see-through in some strange way where the aerials would be hidden under tire treads
* They were difficult to customize much because he kept himself to the limitations of the game;
* The stock aerials he used had some of the aerial body on the tip, which without modification limited what he could do with them
* No replacement beachball was included to account for his changes in FxPage1.bmp

This last change made me break down and make this kit. Since its creation in 2001, Iron Bob's Aerials didn't have much spread in the Re-Volt community, and I hope that by making my own pack, I can present a more easy-to-use and customizable alternative to his pack, with improved Aerial models and way more colours.

You can download this pack from https://github.com/Hebgbs/EBA or via the URL file the author (should have) included in the eba-docs folder.
