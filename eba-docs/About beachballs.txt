This docuent will explain about the beachballs.

So what are they, and why are they so important? I mean, it's just a thing you bat around, right? But Iron Bob's Aerials broke that, too! The new beachballs included are there to replace and improve upon the already-existing beachball model. So here's a quick run-down of the beachballs for people to understand;

./models/sfbeachball.m
This is the "Scalefix" beachball. It is referred to as "Scalefix" because it re-scales the beachball mapping so all faces refer to a single point on the UV map of their respective colour. This is the method my aerials use, and it forces the game to settle on one colour, which upon rendering will remove the odd gradients that existed with the beachball originally.

./models/bfbeachball.m
This is the "Blockfix" beachball, which was originally made by Gel38 as an idea to fix the beachball originally. By default it uses blocks that have the original intended colour the ball was trying to use, which means you get the "True" colour of each beachball segment. But also, you can change the colours and make it your own, and edit per-level what the beachball looks like, should you want to do that.

Each of the scripts included will delete beachball.m (if it exists), then perform a copy or a link of either depending on which method of duplication is used.
