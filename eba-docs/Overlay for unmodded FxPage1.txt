The included overlay has everything you need to resolve compatibility issues. To use, perform the following;

(Recommended free tools: GIMP, XnView)

* Open your layer-capable image editor
* Load the target FxPage1.bmp file
* Open / import EBA-overlay.png
* line it up so the overlay is entirely in the canvas
* Flatten layers
* Export to PNG, if your editor is not known for saving usable bitmaps
* If exported to PNG, open the image into a converter capable of PNG to BMP
* Export to BMP, overwriting the target FxPage1.bmp
