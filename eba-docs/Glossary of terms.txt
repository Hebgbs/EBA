Since some people will be confused by the swirl of letters, terms and instructions, I figured I would include this handy glossary of terms for people to use as they read the other material. Since everything here was made in a non-Windows system first, I use terms that are not native to Windows users, thus these terms are also included so you can dicipher the names of files this mod use.

=== A ===
* Aerial
Another word for antenna, basically; The things that are on most vehicles in Re-Volt to represent the antenna normally used to operate them. A mostly cosmetic feature that bends at speed.

=== B ===
* Bash
Bourne Again shell, the most used command interpreter outside of Windows.

* Becahball
An inflatible spherical object intended for play. Often made of vinyl, and may be easily punctured depending on manufacturer. In Re-Volt, it is the model that became a little messed up thanks to Iron Bob and his kit.

* bf
Blockfix, the name given to the remapped beachball using a sizable block of gfx/Fxpage1.bmp instead. Needs the included GFX that comes with EBA to appear as intended.

=== C ===
* cd
Change directory, a nearly universal command in all prompts. Necessary to understand, as you'll need to change directory to the root of your game installation in a command prompt / terminal.

* cmd
Windows' Command prompt

* cp
GNU coreutils; Copy, allows people to make copies of files. The equivalent in Windows is either copy or xcopy

=== E ===
* EBA
ElectricBee's Aerials

* EBAs
ElectricBee's Aerials; Aerial stem / body

* EBAt
ElectricBee's Aerials; Aerial tip / top

=== I ===
* IBA
Iron Bob's Aerials, thhe buggy mod that eventually made me take action and create my own mod for them.

=== L ===
* ln
GNU coreutils; Link, allows people to create links to files in different ways, using either the file name or index node of a source file to create a shortcut of the file targeted. The equivalent in Windows (Vista+) is mklink

=== S ===
* sf
Scalefix, the name given to the remapped beachball model using single-point instead of the standard beachball that looks a little ugly up close.

=== T ===
Terminal, the name given to a shell operating outside of a graphical environment, or used with in a graphical environment; See below.

Terminal Emulator, an application that provides a terminal much like what you would see outside of your graphical environment. Most non-Windows systems include such a thing.
