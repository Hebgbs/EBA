If you've opened this, then you probably don't want to do a whole lot of reading. You're still going to be doing a whole lot of reading, but this summarizes what is in DETAILS.TXT which means less time reading, and more time doing. just read the stuff in quotes until you find what applies to you and do that.

Each of these imply you already have either cmd or a terminal open depending on system. Since the majority of users are on Windows, use cases for them are on top.

Windows: OPEN CMD AS ADMIN if you need to. Easiest way is to seatch for cmd.exe, right-click on the binary and open as administrator.

To make the decision even easier for you, the scripts in eba-inst\copy files ensure a universally-usable installation between systems. If you need the extra disk space that badly, eba-inst\link files includes scripts for nuts who want to keep their used disk space as low as possible, but are not interoperable with RVGL, which means it doesn't matter what method you pick if you're going to use Wine to run Re-Volt for Windows outside of its native system anyway.

WINDOWS (cd to game directory)
------------------------------
"I want the best compatibility between systems possible"
Do "eba-inst\copy files\inst_sf.bat"

"I want the best compatibility between systems possible with option to customize beachball"
Do "eba-inst\copy files\inst_bf.bat"

"My disk space is low! Can I just make links to files?"
If on Vista or greater, on an NTFS filesystem, do "eba-inst\link files\inst_sf.bat"

"My disk space is low! Can I still have the customizable beachball?"
If on Vista or greater, on an NTFS filesystem, do "eba-inst\link files\inst_bf.bat"

"I hate this and I want it dead"
Do eba-bat\rm.bat

NON-WINDOWS (cd to game directory)
