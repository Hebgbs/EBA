For nuts who want to keep their disk space low, there are scripts that will make symbolic links of files for you, but there may be issues using these links in certain conditions. Below are the guaranteed conditions for success;

> Use of the shell scripts with sh on any open-source system with RVGL installed

Beachballs;
> Scalefix: Uses the same texturing method as the aerials to fix the beachball's appearance
> Blockfix: Uses the block in ./gfx/fxpage1.bmp provided by this mod; Customizable
