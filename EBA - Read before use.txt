"Woah, what? What are all of these folders?!"

Relax, I know it's a little overwhelming. I kept everything in folders to tidy up the archive, and keep your installation from being a mess of scripts and other guff.

Had ElectricBee's Aerials before? If you wish, Prior to extracting, cd to your game directory then perform the following;
* Windows
del /Q eba*

* Other systems
rm -rf eba*

Other things you can do that might help to "Clean-slate" your Re-Volt installation, had you installed EBA before:
1. Resetting everything prior to overwriting:
  > Windows
  eba-bat/reset.bat
  > Other systems
  sh eba-sh\reset.sh

2. Nuking it from orbit
  > Windows
  eba-bat/rm.bat
  > Other systems
  sh eba-sh\rm.sh

Here's what each folder is about:

* eba-docs
Information you need to know. IMPORTANT; Visit this folder first!

* eba-inst
Installer scripts. Information in eba-docs/details.txt

* eba-bat
Batch files for Windows

* eba-sh
Shell scripts for other systems; Windows users need not apply.

View the contents of each folder for more information about what each of the files do.
